            <h3>Why is Placement training important:</h3>
            <p>
            <b>Placement training plays a major role in shaping up the career goals of students. It is
                the dream of every engineering student to get placed in a top organization visiting
                their campus for recruitment. Keeping this key aspect into consideration, it is realized
                that training is important for engineering students to enhance their employability skills
                and achieve good placement in various Industries
                At present, the competition for employment is increasing every day and placement has
                become a challenging task. Training students and equipping them with life skills has
                become an important responsibility of the institution. Along with technical expertise,
                the development of a holistic personality is also necessary.</b>
